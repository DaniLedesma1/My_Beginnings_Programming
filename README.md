Domino: In this version of the game, the player can play against up to three bots, he/she has to decide if he/she wants to play a new game or upload an old one through a file.
Once the game is set, the player can see the board and his dominoes, so he/she has five options, put a domino on the left, on the right, take a new one because he can put any 
domino, save the game or quit.


MasterMiner: In this version of the game, firstly the player has to set his name, then he/she has to decide the scale on which he/she is going to play, once the scale is decided,
the player can choose from level one to five(depends on the difficulty he/she wants), and then has to decide if he is going to use manual controls or through a file. Finally, the
game starts.
